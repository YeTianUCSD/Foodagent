As a knowledgeable and empathetic health assistant, your primary objective is to provide the user with precise and valuable information regarding their health and well-being. Utilize the available tools effectively to answer health-related queries. Here are the tools at your disposal:

-----------------------------------
**extract_text**: Extract all the text on the current webpage
This tool have the following outputs:
An string containing the text of the scraped webpage.
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
**google_search**: Uses google to search the internet for the requested query and returns the url of the top website.
This tool have the following outputs:
It returns a json object containing key: **url**. For example: {'url': 'http://google.com'}
-----------------------------------


The following is the format of the information provided:
MetaData: this contains the name of data files of different types like image, audio, video, and text. You can pass these files to tools when needed.
History: the history of previous chats happened. Review the history for any previous responses relevant to the current query
PreviousActions: the list of already performed actions. You should start planning knowing that these actions are performed.
Question: the input question you must answer.

Considering previously actions and their results, use the tools and provided information, first suggest three creative strategies with detailed explanation consisting of sequences of tools to properly answer the user query. Make sure the strategies are comprehensive enough and use proper tools. The tools constraints should be always satisfied. 
After specifying the strategies, mention the pros and cons of each strategy. In the end decide the best strategy and write the detailed tool executions step by step.
start your final decision with
'Decision:'. Only **one** decision should appear behind 'Decision:' tag

I will choose **Strategy 3: Search for a comprehensive health resource** as the best approach to answer the user's query. This strategy is reliable, provides comprehensive information, and is less likely to provide outdated information.

Here are the step-by-step executions of the chosen strategy:

1. **google_search**: Search for "National Sleep Foundation sleep duration" to find a comprehensive health resource.
   Tool output: {'url': 'https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need'}
2. **extract_text**: Extract the text from the webpage at the provided URL.
   Tool output: A string containing the text of the webpage.
3. Review the extracted text to find the most accurate and up-to-date information about the recommended sleep duration.

The extracted text states that adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health

October 1, 2020 / Sleep and You Getting enough sleep is doable and important for your health. Read on for how many hours to strive for at every age. Sleep is essential to feeling rested and alert. Getting the right amount for your mind and body feels great and helps you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go. Every person is different when it comes to the exact amount of sleep that’s optimal for them, but most people fall within a range, depending on their age. These guidelines can help you determine how much sleep you really need, while providing some easy ways to achieve it. How Many Hours of Sleep Do You Need? There is no precise number of minutes or hours of sleep at night that guarantees you will wake up feeling totally refreshed. But based on your age and lifestyle, what’s recommended for you likely falls within a certain range. To help yourself stay alert during the day, try sticking with these guidelines. Newborns: From 0-3 months, babies need between 14 and 17 hours of sleep. This includes daytime naps, since newborns rarely sleep through the night. Older infants (4-11 months) need about 12 to 15 hours of sleep each day. Toddlers: Between the first and second year of life, toddlers need between 11 and 14 hours of sleep each night. Children: Preschoolers (3-5 years) should get 10 to 13 hours, while school-age kids (6-13 years) should strive for nine to 11 hours each night. Teenagers: As kids get older, their need for sleep decreases slightly. Teens (14-17 years) require about eight to 10 hours of nightly sleep. Adults: Between the ages of 18 and 64, adults should aim for seven to nine hours of nightly sleep. If you’re older than 65, you may need a little less: seven to eight hours is recommended. Build in Some Flex Time Some people can function well on the lower end of the range and others will need every minute of the upper limit. In fact, an additional hour or two on either side of a given range may be appropriate, depending on the person. Still, straying too far from the recommended amount could lead to a variety of health issues. For example, shortchanging sleep has been associated with weight gain, reduced immunity, high blood pressure, and depression. The negative effects of too little or too much sleep aren’t just physical—they can also interfere with your mental health. Your outlook, mood, and attention span all depend on getting the right amount of sleep, and without it, your job performance (not to mention your personal life) can suffer. Easy Ways to Get More Sleep If getting enough sleep seems like an uphill battle, there are a few tips you can try. To start, head to bed at the same time every night, to allow your body to settle into a regular sleep-wake schedule. Just the way kids benefit from a set schedule, adults who stick to a regular pre-sleep routine that includes reading, meditation, journaling, and a warm bath may find it easier to wind down in the evening. To help get quality sleep, avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy and fried foods right before bedtime. Aim for a bedroom temperature between 60 and 67 °F , make sure it’s dark, and block any bothersome noises with a pair of earplugs. For a fuller list of sleep tips, read them here .

October 1, 2020 / Sleep and You Getting enough sleep is doable and important for your health. Read on for how many hours to strive for at every age. Sleep is essential to feeling rested and alert. Getting the right amount for your mind and body feels great and helps you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go. Every person is different when it comes to the exact amount of sleep that’s optimal for them, but most people fall within a range, depending on their age. These guidelines can help you determine how much sleep you really need, while providing some easy ways to achieve it. How Many Hours of Sleep Do You Need? There is no precise number of minutes or hours of sleep at night that guarantees you will wake up feeling totally refreshed. But based on your age and lifestyle, what’s recommended for you likely falls within a certain range. To help yourself stay alert during the day, try sticking with these guidelines. Newborns: From 0-3 months, babies need between 14 and 17 hours of sleep. This includes daytime naps, since newborns rarely sleep through the night. Older infants (4-11 months) need about 12 to 15 hours of sleep each day. Toddlers: Between the first and second year of life, toddlers need between 11 and 14 hours of sleep each night. Children: Preschoolers (3-5 years) should get 10 to 13 hours, while school-age kids (6-13 years) should strive for nine to 11 hours each night. Teenagers: As kids get older, their need for sleep decreases slightly. Teens (14-17 years) require about eight to 10 hours of nightly sleep. Adults: Between the ages of 18 and 64, adults should aim for seven to nine hours of nightly sleep. If you’re older than 65, you may need a little less: seven to eight hours is recommended. Build in Some Flex Time Some people can function well on the lower end of the range and others will need every minute of the upper limit. In fact, an additional hour or two on either side of a given range may be appropriate, depending on the person. Still, straying too far from the recommended amount could lead to a variety of health issues. For example, shortchanging sleep has been associated with weight gain, reduced immunity, high blood pressure, and depression. The negative effects of too little or too much sleep aren’t just physical—they can also interfere with your mental health. Your outlook, mood, and attention span all depend on getting the right amount of sleep, and without it, your job performance (not to mention your personal life) can suffer. Easy Ways to Get More Sleep If getting enough sleep seems like an uphill battle, there are a few tips you can try. To start, head to bed at the same time every night, to allow your body to settle into a regular sleep-wake schedule. Just the way kids benefit from a set schedule, adults who stick to a regular pre-sleep routine that includes reading, meditation, journaling, and a warm bath may find it easier to wind down in the evening. To help get quality sleep, avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy and fried foods right before bedtime. Aim for a bedroom temperature between 60 and 67 °F , make sure it’s dark, and block any bothersome noises with a pair of earplugs. For a fuller list of sleep tips, read them here .

What Happens if You Don’t Get Enough Sleep? How Can You Improve Your Sleep? Key Takeaways Most healthy adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. Infants, young children, and teenagers should get more sleep to support their growth and development. Feel like you’re constantly chasing sleep but never sure if you’re getting enough? Figuring out how much sleep you actually need can feel like solving a mystery. But sleep isn’t a luxury—it’s a biological necessity—and getting the right amount can mean the difference between powering through your day and dragging yourself through it. So how many hours do you really need to feel rested, focused, and at your best? Let’s break it down. How Many Hours of Sleep Do You Need? As a basic rule, healthy adults need at least seven hours of sleep per night Trusted Source American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) AASM sets standards and promotes excellence in sleep medicine health care, education, and research. View Source . Babies , young children , and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and development Trusted Source Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (JCSM) JCSM is the official, peer-reviewed journal of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. View Source . Getting less than seven hours has been linked to a weakened immune system, reduced job performance, and a heightened risk of accidents (including car accidents). An ongoing lack of sleep is also associated with many serious health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, weight gain, obesity, diabetes, and depression. If seven hours is the minimum, a natural follow-up question is whether adults can sleep too much. According to experts, the answer isn’t so clear. Sometimes sleeping more than nine hours is a sign of an underlying health problem, but getting extra sleep can be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as when you’re sick or trying to catch up on sleep . Recommended Hours of Sleep by Age The amount of sleep a person needs depends on their age. Experts at organizations like the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Sleep Research Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed a recommended sleep chart by age. Scroll L – R for more details Age group Age range Recommended hours of sleep Infant 4-12 months 12-16 hours (including naps) Toddler 1-2 years 11-14 hours (including naps) Preschool 3-5 years 10-13 hours (including naps) School-age 6-12 years 9-12 hours Teen 13-18 years 8-10 hours Adult 18 years and older 7 hours or more There’s no specific recommendation for newborns , because there’s limited research about how much sleep they truly need.

Some people need more or less sleep than the suggested amount for their age. Deciding how much sleep you need means considering your overall health, daily activities, and typical sleeping patterns. Some questions that can help you assess your individual sleep needs include: Are you productive, healthy, and happy on seven hours of sleep? Or have you noticed that you require more hours of sleep to get into high gear? Do you unwillingly doze off during the day? Do you have health issues that might require more rest? Are you taking any medications that affect your sleep or daytime energy levels? Do you have a high level of daily energy expenditure? Do you frequently play sports or work in a labor-intensive job? Do your daily activities require alertness to do them safely? Do you drive every day or operate heavy machinery? Do you feel sleepy while doing these activities? Are you experiencing or do you have a history of a sleep disorder ? Do you depend on caffeine to get you through the day? When you have an open schedule, do you tend to sleep more? Are you pregnant or breastfeeding? You can use your answers to these questions to hone in on your optimal amount of sleep. You can also talk to your doctor to review your overall health, your typical sleep patterns, and whether you might need more or less sleep than recommended. You may find that having sleep-related data can help you think about these questions. For example, keeping a sleep diary or wearing a sleep tracker may help you detect trends in how you sleep at night and how it affects you during the day. Sleep Quality vs. Quantity When thinking about sleep needs, it’s easy to focus on quantity.

How Do You Know if You’re Getting Enough Sleep? It’s challenging to know if you’re actually getting enough sleep. Reflecting on three key factors can help determine if you’re getting the right amount of rest. How you wake up: If you feel refreshed when you wake up, that’s a good sign. If you struggle to start your day, it may indicate that you’re short on sleep. Sleepiness during the day: If you find that you’re nodding off or extremely tired during the day, it could be a result of insufficient sleep at night. Your concentration levels: Good sleep helps you focus, so if you have trouble with concentration, it might be because you’re not getting enough sleep. Track Your Sleep Quantity and Quality Sleep tracking devices and apps can reveal patterns in your sleep duration, quality, and disruptions, giving you a clearer picture of whether your nightly rest is restorative. According to a SleepFoundation.org survey, people who use a sleep tracker are more than two and a half times more likely than those who don’t to report waking up feeling “very alert.” Conversely, people who don’t use a tracker were nearly 20% more likely to say they wake up feeling groggy. While sleep trackers can’t diagnose disorders, they can be a useful tool for developing better sleep habits. Use them in combination with a simple self-check each morning: Do you feel refreshed? Are you able to stay alert and focused throughout the day without relying heavily on caffeine? If not, you may not be getting enough quality sleep — even if your total time in bed seems sufficient. What Happens if You Don’t Get Enough Sleep? Not getting enough sleep can have far-reaching consequences. Some of the immediate signs of sleep deprivation include: Extreme tiredness during the day Slowed thinking and reaction time, heightening the risk of errors and accidents Reduced focus and memory Irritability Feelings of anxiety or depression If insufficient sleep becomes a lasting problem, it can also give rise to other health issues, including: High blood pressure, heart problems, and stroke Decreased immune function Type 2 diabetes Kidney disease Obesity Learn Even More About Sleep Sign up to receive emails about how to improve your sleep,\u2028as well as our comprehensive Better Sleep Guidebook. How Can You Improve Your Sleep? To improve your sleep, start by making sleep a priority in your schedule. This means calculating the hours you need so that work or social activities don’t infringe on time for sleep. It’s also worth taking steps to boost your sleep quality. Enhancing your bedroom setting and sleep-related habits can make it easier to get the quantity and quality of sleep you need .\xa0 Practical ways that you can improve your sleep hygiene include Trusted Source Medline Plus MedlinePlus is an online health information resource for patients and their families and friends. View Source : Sticking to the same sleep schedule every day, even on weekends Practicing a relaxing bedtime routine to make it easier to fall asleep quickly Choosing a supportive, comfortable mattress and outfitting your bed with quality pillows and bedding Minimizing potential disruptions from light and sound while optimizing your bedroom temperature (between 65 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit) Disconnecting from electronic devices like mobile phones and laptops for at least 30 minutes and ideally an hour before bed Avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon or evening Limiting alcohol consumption, especially in the hours before bed If you’re a parent or caregiver, many of the same tips apply to help children and teens get the recommended amount of sleep.If you or a family member are experiencing symptoms such as significant sleepiness during the day, insomnia , leg cramps, snoring, or another issue that is preventing you from sleeping well, talk with a doctor to determine the underlying cause. Frequently Asked Questions What is the 10-3-2-1-0 rule for sleep? The 10-3-2-1-0 rule is a method of enhancing sleep hygiene. Each number represents a certain habit that can make it easier to get good sleep. -Avoid caffeine consumption for 10 hours before bedtime. -Do not drink alcohol or eat any food for 3 hours before going to bed. -Finish all work-related tasks 2 hours before bed to give your mind time to wind down. -Stop all screen time, including with your TV or phone, for 1 hour before bedtime. -Wake up when your alarm goes off in the morning with 0 uses of the snooze button. Why is it important to sleep between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.? Your body’s internal clock, also known as its circadian rhythm , functions best when it’s aligned with the timing of day and night Trusted Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) The NHLBI is the nation's leader in the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders. View Source . So sleeping when it’s dark outside (between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.) can support better alignment of your circadian rhythm Trusted Source Merck Manual First published in 1899 as a small reference book for physicians and pharmacists, the Manual grew in size and scope to become one of the most widely used comprehensive medical resources for professionals and consumers. View Source . It’s also when you tend to spend the most time in the deep sleep stage, so not sleeping during these hours may affect whether your sleep feels refreshing. Ultimately, you may not always be able to sleep the entirety of the time between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., but trying to coordinate your schedule to be sleeping when it’s dark outside can help limit circadian misalignment. Why am I still tired after sleeping for 8 hours? Unrefreshing sleep is frequently a consequence of restless sleep. For example, you might have been in bed for eight hours but spent part of that time tossing and turning. This is a common problem for people with insomnia or who have other health issues like acid reflux that interfere with sleep. It could also be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder. Some sleep disorders cause repeated awakenings during the night that detract from your sleep quality, these awakenings are so brief that you don’t even realize they’re happening. For example, sleep apnea, a condition involving repeated breathing interruptions during sleep, can make sleep unrefreshing regardless of how many hours you sleep. Other types of less-common sleep disorders also cause excessive daytime sleepiness Trusted Source Medscape Reference Medscape is on online destination for healthcare professionals worldwide, offering expert perspectives, drug and disease information, and professional education. View Source . Is it healthy to nap during the day? For adults, napping during the day can be healthy, but you want to nap strategically. That means considering the timing and length of any nap. Nap timing: You don’t want to nap too late in the afternoon, which can make it harder for you to fall asleep at your normal bedtime Trusted Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) As the nation’s health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. View Source . Nap length: To avoid waking up groggy from a nap, you should nap for either a maximum of 20 minutes or for about 90 minutes. In this way, you either wake up before entering deeper stages of sleep or you are able to complete a full sleep cycle before waking up. Still have questions? Ask our community!

October 1, 2020 / Sleep and You Getting enough sleep is doable and important for your health. Read on for how many hours to strive for at every age. Sleep is essential to feeling rested and alert. Getting the right amount for your mind and body feels great and helps you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go. Every person is different when it comes to the exact amount of sleep that’s optimal for them, but most people fall within a range, depending on their age. These guidelines can help you determine how much sleep you really need, while providing some easy ways to achieve it. How Many Hours of Sleep Do You Need? There is no precise number of minutes or hours of sleep at night that guarantees you will wake up feeling totally refreshed. But based on your age and lifestyle, what’s recommended for you likely falls within a certain range. To help yourself stay alert during the day, try sticking with these guidelines. Newborns: From 0-3 months, babies need between 14 and 17 hours of sleep. This includes daytime naps, since newborns rarely sleep through the night. Older infants (4-11 months) need about 12 to 15 hours of sleep each day. Toddlers: Between the first and second year of life, toddlers need between 11 and 14 hours of sleep each night. Children: Preschoolers (3-5 years) should get 10 to 13 hours, while school-age kids (6-13 years) should strive for nine to 11 hours each night. Teenagers: As kids get older, their need for sleep decreases slightly. Teens (14-17 years) require about eight to 10 hours of nightly sleep. Adults: Between the ages of 18 and 64, adults should aim for seven to nine hours of nightly sleep. If you’re older than 65, you may need a little less: seven to eight hours is recommended. Build in Some Flex Time Some people can function well on the lower end of the range and others will need every minute of the upper limit. In fact, an additional hour or two on either side of a given range may be appropriate, depending on the person. Still, straying too far from the recommended amount could lead to a variety of health issues. For example, shortchanging sleep has been associated with weight gain, reduced immunity, high blood pressure, and depression. The negative effects of too little or too much sleep aren’t just physical—they can also interfere with your mental health. Your outlook, mood, and attention span all depend on getting the right amount of sleep, and without it, your job performance (not to mention your personal life) can suffer. Easy Ways to Get More Sleep If getting enough sleep seems like an uphill battle, there are a few tips you can try. To start, head to bed at the same time every night, to allow your body to settle into a regular sleep-wake schedule. Just the way kids benefit from a set schedule, adults who stick to a regular pre-sleep routine that includes reading, meditation, journaling, and a warm bath may find it easier to wind down in the evening. To help get quality sleep, avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy and fried foods right before bedtime. Aim for a bedroom temperature between 60 and 67 °F , make sure it’s dark, and block any bothersome noises with a pair of earplugs. For a fuller list of sleep tips, read them here .

What Happens if You Don’t Get Enough Sleep? How Can You Improve Your Sleep? Key Takeaways Most healthy adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. Infants, young children, and teenagers should get more sleep to support their growth and development. Feel like you’re constantly chasing sleep but never sure if you’re getting enough? Figuring out how much sleep you actually need can feel like solving a mystery. But sleep isn’t a luxury—it’s a biological necessity—and getting the right amount can mean the difference between powering through your day and dragging yourself through it. So how many hours do you really need to feel rested, focused, and at your best? Let’s break it down. How Many Hours of Sleep Do You Need? As a basic rule, healthy adults need at least seven hours of sleep per night Trusted Source American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) AASM sets standards and promotes excellence in sleep medicine health care, education, and research. View Source . Babies , young children , and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and development Trusted Source Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (JCSM) JCSM is the official, peer-reviewed journal of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. View Source . Getting less than seven hours has been linked to a weakened immune system, reduced job performance, and a heightened risk of accidents (including car accidents). An ongoing lack of sleep is also associated with many serious health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, weight gain, obesity, diabetes, and depression. If seven hours is the minimum, a natural follow-up question is whether adults can sleep too much. According to experts, the answer isn’t so clear. Sometimes sleeping more than nine hours is a sign of an underlying health problem, but getting extra sleep can be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as when you’re sick or trying to catch up on sleep . Recommended Hours of Sleep by Age The amount of sleep a person needs depends on their age. Experts at organizations like the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Sleep Research Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed a recommended sleep chart by age. Scroll L – R for more details Age group Age range Recommended hours of sleep Infant 4-12 months 12-16 hours (including naps) Toddler 1-2 years 11-14 hours (including naps) Preschool 3-5 years 10-13 hours (including naps) School-age 6-12 years 9-12 hours Teen 13-18 years 8-10 hours Adult 18 years and older 7 hours or more There’s no specific recommendation for newborns , because there’s limited research about how much sleep they truly need. That said, babies under four months often sleep between 14 and 17 hours per day Trusted Source Medline Plus MedlinePlus is an online health information resource for patients and their families and friends. View Source . Finding the Right Amount of Sleep for You These guidelines serve as a rule of thumb for how much sleep babies, children, and adults need. Experts acknowledge that the ideal amount of sleep can vary from person to person Trusted Source UpToDate More than 2 million healthcare providers around the world choose UpToDate to help make appropriate care decisions and drive better health outcomes. UpToDate delivers evidence-based clinical decision support that is clear, actionable, and rich with real-world insights. View Source . Some people need more or less sleep than the suggested amount for their age. Deciding how much sleep you need means considering your overall health, daily activities, and typical sleeping patterns. Some questions that can help you assess your individual sleep needs include: Are you productive, healthy, and happy on seven hours of sleep? Or have you noticed that you require more hours of sleep to get into high gear? Do you unwillingly doze off during the day? Do you have health issues that might require more rest? Are you taking any medications that affect your sleep or daytime energy levels? Do you have a high level of daily energy expenditure? Do you frequently play sports or work in a labor-intensive job? Do your daily activities require alertness to do them safely? Do you drive every day or operate heavy machinery? Do you feel sleepy while doing these activities? Are you experiencing or do you have a history of a sleep disorder ? Do you depend on caffeine to get you through the day? When you have an open schedule, do you tend to sleep more? Are you pregnant or breastfeeding? You can use your answers to these questions to hone in on your optimal amount of sleep. You can also talk to your doctor to review your overall health, your typical sleep patterns, and whether you might need more or less sleep than recommended. You may find that having sleep-related data can help you think about these questions. For example, keeping a sleep diary or wearing a sleep tracker may help you detect trends in how you sleep at night and how it affects you during the day. Sleep Quality vs. Quantity When thinking about sleep needs, it’s easy to focus on quantity. But a good night’s rest isn’t just about how many hours you’re asleep— the quality of your sleep is just as important. Low-quality sleep often feels restless or disrupted, making it less refreshing than solid, continuous sleep Trusted Source Sleep Disorders View Source . Fragmented sleep hinders your ability to progress through the four stages of sleep , all of which are necessary for healthy sleep Trusted Source Medline Plus MedlinePlus is an online health information resource for patients and their families and friends.

View Source . These sleep cycles are made up of four stages of sleep. All four stages are important to good sleep, but two specific stages have an especially big impact. During deep sleep , also known as stage 3 sleep, your breathing and heart rate slow down, and your brain and body relax Trusted Source National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) NINDS aims to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. View Source . This aids in your body’s rest and recovery, allowing you to wake up feeling rejuvenated. Deep sleep also contributes to the health of your immune system, bones, and other tissues Trusted Source StatPearls View Source .

How Do You Know if You’re Getting Enough Sleep? It’s challenging to know if you’re actually getting enough sleep. Reflecting on three key factors can help determine if you’re getting the right amount of rest. How you wake up: If you feel refreshed when you wake up, that’s a good sign. If you struggle to start your day, it may indicate that you’re short on sleep. Sleepiness during the day: If you find that you’re nodding off or extremely tired during the day, it could be a result of insufficient sleep at night. Your concentration levels: Good sleep helps you focus, so if you have trouble with concentration, it might be because you’re not getting enough sleep. Track Your Sleep Quantity and Quality Sleep tracking devices and apps can reveal patterns in your sleep duration, quality, and disruptions, giving you a clearer picture of whether your nightly rest is restorative. According to a SleepFoundation.org survey, people who use a sleep tracker are more than two and a half times more likely than those who don’t to report waking up feeling “very alert.” Conversely, people who don’t use a tracker were nearly 20% more likely to say they wake up feeling groggy. While sleep trackers can’t diagnose disorders, they can be a useful tool for developing better sleep habits. Use them in combination with a simple self-check each morning: Do you feel refreshed? Are you able to stay alert and focused throughout the day without relying heavily on caffeine? If not, you may not be getting enough quality sleep — even if your total time in bed seems sufficient. What Happens if You Don’t Get Enough Sleep? Not getting enough sleep can have far-reaching consequences. Some of the immediate signs of sleep deprivation include: Extreme tiredness during the day Slowed thinking and reaction time, heightening the risk of errors and accidents Reduced focus and memory Irritability Feelings of anxiety or depression If insufficient sleep becomes a lasting problem, it can also give rise to other health issues, including: High blood pressure, heart problems, and stroke Decreased immune function Type 2 diabetes Kidney disease Obesity Learn Even More About Sleep Sign up to receive emails about how to improve your sleep,\u2028as well as our comprehensive Better Sleep Guidebook. How Can You Improve Your Sleep? To improve your sleep, start by making sleep a priority in your schedule. This means calculating the hours you need so that work or social activities don’t infringe on time for sleep. It’s also worth taking steps to boost your sleep quality. Enhancing your bedroom setting and sleep-related habits can make it easier to get the quantity and quality of sleep you need .\xa0 Practical ways that you can improve your sleep hygiene include Trusted Source Medline Plus MedlinePlus is an online health information resource for patients and their families and friends. View Source : Sticking to the same sleep schedule every day, even on weekends Practicing a relaxing bedtime routine to make it easier to fall asleep quickly Choosing a supportive, comfortable mattress and outfitting your bed with quality pillows and bedding Minimizing potential disruptions from light and sound while optimizing your bedroom temperature (between 65 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit) Disconnecting from electronic devices like mobile phones and laptops for at least 30 minutes and ideally an hour before bed Avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon or evening Limiting alcohol consumption, especially in the hours before bed If you’re a parent or caregiver, many of the same tips apply to help children and teens get the recommended amount of sleep.If you or a family member are experiencing symptoms such as significant sleepiness during the day, insomnia , leg cramps, snoring, or another issue that is preventing you from sleeping well, talk with a doctor to determine the underlying cause. Frequently Asked Questions What is the 10-3-2-1-0 rule for sleep? The 10-3-2-1-0 rule is a method of enhancing sleep hygiene. Each number represents a certain habit that can make it easier to get good sleep. -Avoid caffeine consumption for 10 hours before bedtime. -Do not drink alcohol or eat any food for 3 hours before going to bed. -Finish all work-related tasks 2 hours before bed to give your mind time to wind down. -Stop all screen time, including with your TV or phone, for 1 hour before bedtime. -Wake up when your alarm goes off in the morning with 0 uses of the snooze button. Why is it important to sleep between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.? Your body’s internal clock, also known as its circadian rhythm , functions best when it’s aligned with the timing of day and night Trusted Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) The NHLBI is the nation's leader in the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders. View Source . So sleeping when it’s dark outside (between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.) can support better alignment of your circadian rhythm Trusted Source Merck Manual First published in 1899 as a small reference book for physicians and pharmacists, the Manual grew in size and scope to become one of the most widely used comprehensive medical resources for professionals and consumers. View Source . It’s also when you tend to spend the most time in the deep sleep stage, so not sleeping during these hours may affect whether your sleep feels refreshing. Ultimately, you may not always be able to sleep the entirety of the time between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., but trying to coordinate your schedule to be sleeping when it’s dark outside can help limit circadian misalignment. Why am I still tired after sleeping for 8 hours? Unrefreshing sleep is frequently a consequence of restless sleep. For example, you might have been in bed for eight hours but spent part of that time tossing and turning. This is a common problem for people with insomnia or who have other health issues like acid reflux that interfere with sleep. It could also be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder. Some sleep disorders cause repeated awakenings during the night that detract from your sleep quality, these awakenings are so brief that you don’t even realize they’re happening. For example, sleep apnea, a condition involving repeated breathing interruptions during sleep, can make sleep unrefreshing regardless of how many hours you sleep. Other types of less-common sleep disorders also cause excessive daytime sleepiness Trusted Source Medscape Reference Medscape is on online destination for healthcare professionals worldwide, offering expert perspectives, drug and disease information, and professional education. View Source . Is it healthy to nap during the day? For adults, napping during the day can be healthy, but you want to nap strategically. That means considering the timing and length of any nap. Nap timing: You don’t want to nap too late in the afternoon, which can make it harder for you to fall asleep at your normal bedtime Trusted Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) As the nation’s health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. View Source . Nap length: To avoid waking up groggy from a nap, you should nap for either a maximum of 20 minutes or for about 90 minutes. In this way, you either wake up before entering deeper stages of sleep or you are able to complete a full sleep cycle before waking up. Still have questions? Ask our community!

failed inputs: 





=========================
Tools:

-----------------------------------
**extract_text**: Extract all the text on the current webpage
This tool have the following outputs:
An string containing the text of the scraped webpage.
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
**google_search**: Uses google to search the internet for the requested query and returns the url of the top website.
This tool have the following outputs:
It returns a json object containing key: **url**. For example: {'url': 'http://google.com'}
-----------------------------------

=========================

You are a skilled Python programmer tasked with executing a specific strategy by calling tools.

Your output **must follow the STRICT FORMAT below**. If you fail to follow it, your output will be rejected.

Your response **must contain ONLY the four tagged sections below, in EXACTLY this order**:

[STRATEGY_CHANGE]  
- `yes` if the overall strategy should be redesigned, otherwise `no`.

[STEP_SUCCESS]  
- `yes` if the *most recent* step (whose result is shown above) ran without error, otherwise `no`.

[STRATEGY_COMPLETE]  
- `yes` if the goal has been fully achieved and we can stop execution, otherwise `no`.

[CONTENT]  
- If `[STRATEGY_CHANGE] = yes`, provide the **new full strategy** (plain text).
- If `[STRATEGY_COMPLETE] = no` AND `[STEP_SUCCESS] = yes`, provide the **next step** as lines of Python code inside a code block.  
- If `[STRATEGY_COMPLETE] = no` AND `[STEP_SUCCESS] = no`, retry the failed step as lines of Python code inside a code block.
- If `[STRATEGY_COMPLETE] = yes`, leave this section **empty**.

Coding rules for the ```python``` block:
- Use this format: `result = self.execute_task('<tool_name>', ['arg1', 'arg2', ...])`
- Always pass the second argument as a list.
- Store the result in a variable (`result`, or a meaningful name).
- Do **NOT** include explanations, comments, markdown headers, or any extra text outside the code block.
- Your entire response must consist **only** of the four blocks above.

Failing to strictly follow this format will cause your output to be discarded.

Example of a valid answer:

[STRATEGY_CHANGE] no
[STEP_SUCCESS] yes
[STRATEGY_COMPLETE] no
[CONTENT]
```python
result = self.execute_task('TASK_NAME', [INPUTS])
```
