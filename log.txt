- Considers both quantitative sleep data and qualitative expert advice.
Cons:
- Relies on external sources for expert advice, which may not fully align with the user's needs.

Decision:
The best strategy is Strategy 3, as it combines the user's sleep data with expert advice for a more personalized and comprehensive approach to improving sleep.

Detailed tool executions for Strategy 3:
1. Use **affect_sleep_get** to retrieve the sleep data for the user over the past two days.
2. Capture the sleep data and utilize the **google_search** tool to find expert advice or articles on improving sleep patterns.
3. Combine the sleep data and expert advice to tailor personalized strategies for the user to improve their sleep.

=========================

You are skilled python programmer that can solve problems and convert them into python codes. Using the selected final strategy mentioned in the 'Decision:
', create a python code inside a ```python ``` block that outlines a sequence of steps using the Tools. assume that there is an **self.execute_task** function that can execute the tools in it. The execute_task recieves task name and an array of the inputs and returns the result. Make sure that you always pass and array as second argument. You can call tools like this: **task_result = self.execute_task('tool_name', ['input_1', 'input2', ...])**. The flow should utilize this style representing the tools available. Make sure all the execute_task calls outputs are stored in a variable.If a step's output is required as input for a subsequent step, ensure the python code captures this dependency clearly. The output variables should directly passed as inputs with no changes in the wording.
If the tool input is a datapipe only put the variable as the input. For each tool, include necessary parameters directly without any names and assume each will return an output. The outputs' description are provided for each Tool individually. Make sure you use the directives when passing the outputs.
