DataPipes
=========


The **Data Pipe** is a repository of metadata and data acquired from **Uploaded files such as images and videos** and **Tasks' Results** through the execution of conversational sessions.
This component is essential because numerous multimodal analysis involve intermediate stages, and their associated data must be retained for future retrieval. For detailed information you can see our framework paper: `Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02374>`_
