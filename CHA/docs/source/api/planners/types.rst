Types
=====

A primary objective of our framework is to simplify its usage for those who wish to employ it without delving into development.
We aim to offer them a straightforward and effortless setup process, minimizing the complexities and initializations associated with numerous classes.
This approach reduces potential bugs and allows users to focus on their primary task: developing an application using our framework.
To ensure uniformity throughout the framework and to effectively manage new Planners while avoiding incorrect class initializations,
we have introduced **Types** identifiers. These identifiers, at a high level, determine the specific type of planner required.
Consequently, CHA users are relieved from the intricate details of initializing Planner objects, integrating them into the CHA, and handling setups.



Planner Types
-------------


This enumeration class defines different types of planner. This ensures consistency in case the planner developer
decides to change the name of their planner, the end user need not to change their code cause they use the **keys**.
It inherits from the `str` class and the `Enum` class in Python's `enum` module.
Each value in this enumeration represents a specific type of planner. The **key** naming convention should be all uppercase with underscore,
and the **value** naming convention should be underscore_case: `NAME_OF_PLANNER = this_is_a_sample_planner_name`

This dictionary is used to map each PlannerType value to its corresponding Planner class.
It allows for easy retrieval of the appropriate class based on the planner type.
