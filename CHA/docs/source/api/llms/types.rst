Types
=====

A primary objective of our framework is to simplify its usage for those who wish to employ it without delving into development. \
We aim to offer them a straightforward and effortless setup process, minimizing the complexities and initializations associated with numerous classes. \
This approach reduces potential bugs and allows users to focus on their primary task: developing an application using our framework. \
To ensure uniformity throughout the framework and to effectively manage new LLMs while avoiding incorrect class initializations, \
we have introduced **Types** identifiers. These identifiers, at a high level, determine the specific type of llm required. \
Consequently, CHA users are relieved from the intricate details of initializing LLM objects, integrating them into the CHA, and handling setups.


LLM Types
---------


This enumeration class defines different types of llm. This ensures consistency in case the llm developer \
decides to change the name of their llm, the end user need not to change their code cause they use the **keys**.
It inherits from the `str` class and the `Enum` class in Python's `enum` module.
Each value in this enumeration represents a specific type of llm. The **key** naming convention should be all uppercase with underscore, \
and the **value** naming convention should be underscore_case: `NAME_OF_LLM = this_is_a_sample_llm_name`

Types
-----

This dictionary is used to map each LLMType value to its corresponding LLM class.
It allows for easy retrieval of the appropriate class based on the llm type.
