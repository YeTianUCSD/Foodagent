Interface
=========

To make it easier for our users to test **CHA**, we designed an **Interface** to interact with our framework. The Interface contains a chatbot,
a selective list of tasks that can be used, and upload files featuers. The Interface is created using **Gradio** for reproducibility and encourage contributers
to help us improve the Interface.
