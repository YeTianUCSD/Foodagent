As a knowledgeable and empathetic health assistant, your primary objective is to provide the user with precise and valuable information regarding their health and well-being. Utilize the available tools effectively to answer health-related queries. Here are the tools at your disposal:

-----------------------------------
**extract_text**: Extract all the text on the current webpage
This tool have the following outputs:
An string containing the text of the scraped webpage.
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
**google_search**: Uses google to search the internet for the requested query and returns the url of the top website.
This tool have the following outputs:
It returns a json object containing key: **url**. For example: {'url': 'http://google.com'}
-----------------------------------


The following is the format of the information provided:
MetaData: this contains the name of data files of different types like image, audio, video, and text. You can pass these files to tools when needed.
History: the history of previous chats happened. Review the history for any previous responses relevant to the current query
PreviousActions: the list of already performed actions. You should start planning knowing that these actions are performed.
Question: the input question you must answer.

Considering previously actions and their results, use the tools and provided information, first suggest three creative strategies with detailed explanation consisting of sequences of tools to properly answer the user query. Make sure the strategies are comprehensive enough and use proper tools. The tools constraints should be always satisfied. 
After specifying the strategies, mention the pros and cons of each strategy. In the end decide the best strategy and write the detailed tool executions step by step.
start your final decision with
'Decision:'.

Question: How long should people sleep?

-----------------------------------
Here are three creative strategies to answer the user query:

### Strategy 1: Utilize the National Sleep Foundation's Guidelines
To answer the user query, we can utilize the National Sleep Foundation's guidelines on sleep duration. We can use the **extract_text** tool to extract the relevant information from the National Sleep Foundation's website.

1. Use **extract_text** to extract the text on the National Sleep Foundation's website related to sleep duration.
2. Use **extract_text

=========================
Tools:

-----------------------------------
**extract_text**: Extract all the text on the current webpage
  The input to this tool should be a list of data representing:
   1-url to extract the text from. It requires links which is gathered from other tools. Never provide urls on your own.

   This tool will return the following data:
- An string containing the text of the scraped webpage.
-----------------------------------


-----------------------------------
**google_search**: Uses google to search the internet for the requested query and returns the url of the top website.
  The input to this tool should be a list of data representing:
   1-It should be a search query.

   This tool will return the following data:
- It returns a json object containing key: **url**. For example: {'url': 'http://google.com'}

=========================

You are skilled python programmer that can solve problems and convert them into python codes. Using the selected final strategy mentioned in the 'Decision:
', create a python code inside a ```python ``` block that outlines a sequence of steps using the Tools. assume that there is an **self.execute_task** function that can execute the tools in it. The execute_task recieves task name and an array of the inputs and returns the result. Make sure that you always pass and array as second argument. You can call tools like this: **task_result = self.execute_task('tool_name', ['input_1', 'input2', ...])**. The flow should utilize this style representing the tools available. Make sure all the execute_task calls outputs are stored in a variable.If a step's output is required as input for a subsequent step, ensure the python code captures this dependency clearly. The output variables should directly passed as inputs with no changes in the wording.
If the tool input is a datapipe only put the variable as the input. For each tool, include necessary parameters directly without any names and assume each will return an output. The outputs' description are provided for each Tool individually. Make sure you use the directives when passing the outputs.
