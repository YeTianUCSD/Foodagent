As a knowledgeable and empathetic health assistant, your primary objective is to provide the user with precise and valuable information regarding their health and well-being. Utilize the available tools effectively to answer health-related queries. Here are the tools at your disposal:


The following is the format of the information provided:
MetaData: this contains the name of data files of different types like image, audio, video, and text. You can pass these files to tools when needed.
History: the history of previous chats happened. Review the history for any previous responses relevant to the current query
PreviousActions: the list of already performed actions. You should start planning knowing that these actions are performed.
Question: the input question you must answer.

Considering previously actions and their results, use the tools and provided information, first suggest three creative strategies with detailed explanation consisting of sequences of tools to properly answer the user query. Make sure the strategies are comprehensive enough and use proper tools. The tools constraints should be always satisfied. 
After specifying the strategies, mention the pros and cons of each strategy. In the end decide the best strategy and write the detailed tool executions step by step.
start your final decision with
'Decision:'. Only **one** decision should appear behind 'Decision:' tag

Begin!

Decision:
Based on the information provided, I have devised three strategies to determine what is in the photo referred to by the user.

### Strategy 1: Image Analysis using a Computer Vision Tool
1. **Load Image**: Utilize the path provided by the user to load the image file.
2. **Use Image Recognition Tool**: Utilize a computer vision tool to analyze the content of the image and provide a detailed description.
3. **Interpret Results**: Once the image analysis is complete, summarize the findings and communicate them to the user.

**Pros**: 
- Provides a clear and detailed description.
- Can identify specific objects or features in the image.

**Cons**: 
- Requires correct setup and a working image recognition tool.

You are a skilled Python programmer tasked with executing a specific strategy by calling tools.

Your output **must follow the STRICT FORMAT below**. If you fail to follow it, your output will be rejected.

Your response **must contain ONLY the three tagged sections below, in EXACTLY this order**:

[STRATEGY_CHANGE]  
- `yes` if the overall strategy should be redesigned, otherwise `no`.

[STEP_SUCCESS]  
- `yes` if **all goals have been achieved** and **no further tool calls are required**, otherwise `no`.

[CONTENT]  
- If `[STRATEGY_CHANGE] = yes`, provide the **new full strategy** (plain text, no code).  
- If `[STEP_SUCCESS] = yes`, leave this section **empty**.  
- If `[STEP_SUCCESS] = no`, provide the **next Python code block** that may contain **one or multiple tool calls** needed to advance the strategy.

Coding rules for the ```python``` block:
- Each line must follow the pattern  
  `result = self.execute_task('<tool_name>', ['arg1', 'arg2', ...])`
- All arguments go inside the list.
- You may include **several lines** (i.e., call multiple tools) in a single code block when needed.
- No comments, explanations, markdown headers, or extra text outside the code block.

Failing to strictly follow this format will cause your output to be discarded.

Example of a valid answer when the task is still in progress:

[STRATEGY_CHANGE] no
[STEP_SUCCESS] no
[CONTENT]
```python

````

Example of a valid answer when the task has been completed:

[STRATEGY_CHANGE] no
[STEP_SUCCESS] yes
[CONTENT]


Question: What is in this photo? 

CHA:

====================response start===========================
[STRATEGY_CHANGE] yes
[STEP_SUCCESS] no
[CONTENT]  
### New Strategy: Utilize User Input to Make Educated Guesses
1. **Prompt for Details**: Ask the user for any additional information or context they might have about the photo.
2. **Use Common Categories**: Provide a simplified list of common categories/types of photos and ask if the photo fits into any of these.
3. **Iterative Guessing**: Use a process of elimination based on the user's answers to narrow down possibilities.

**Pros**: 
- Engages the user to gather potentially useful information.
- Allows for educated guessing without access to the actual image content.

**Cons**: 
- Relies heavily on user interactio
