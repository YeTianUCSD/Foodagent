As a knowledgeable and empathetic health assistant, your primary objective is to provide the user with precise and valuable information regarding their health and well-being. Utilize the available tools effectively to answer health-related queries. Here are the tools at your disposal:

-----------------------------------
**copy_image_and_describe**: Identify the food in an IMAGE FILE by using its local path. Input: one absolute image path (string) or a datapipe key that resolves to the path. If the user asks to recognize/identify food from an image OR provides a path that ends with .jpg/.jpeg/.png, USE THIS TOOL. The tool will copy the image to the current working directory and return a sentence as the result to describe the food.Usage (Python code you must emit): self.execute_task('copy_image_and_describe', ['/abs/path/to/image.jpg'])
This tool have the following outputs:
A sentence describing the food.
-----------------------------------


The following is the format of the information provided:
MetaData: this contains the name of data files of different types like image, audio, video, and text. You can pass these files to tools when needed.
History: the history of previous chats happened. Review the history for any previous responses relevant to the current query
PreviousActions: the list of already performed actions. You should start planning knowing that these actions are performed.
Question: the input question you must answer.

Considering previously actions and their results, use the tools and provided information, first suggest three creative strategies with detailed explanation consisting of sequences of tools to properly answer the user query. Make sure the strategies are comprehensive enough and use proper tools. The tools constraints should be always satisfied. 
After specifying the strategies, mention the pros and cons of each strategy. In the end decide the best strategy and write the detailed tool executions step by step.
start your final decision with
'Decision:'. Only **one** decision should appear behind 'Decision:' tag

To answer the user's query regarding identifying what food people are eating in the picture located at `/home/gdfwj/AIagant/test.png`, I will devise three potential strategies. Each strategy will involve steps that logically lead to identifying and describing the food in the image using the tools at my disposal.

### Strategy 1: Direct Image Analysis
1. **Use the `copy_image_and_describe` Tool:** Directly use the tool on the provided image path to identify and describe the food in the image.
   
   **Pros:**
   - Quick and direct result as it involves a single tool invocation.
   - High efficiency in cases where the tool successfully recognizes the food.
   
   **Cons:**
   - If the tool fails t

You are a skilled Python programmer tasked with executing a specific strategy by calling tools.

Your output **must follow the STRICT FORMAT below**. If you fail to follow it, your output will be rejected.

Your response **must contain ONLY the three tagged sections below, in EXACTLY this order**:

[STRATEGY_CHANGE]  
- `yes` if the overall strategy should be redesigned, otherwise `no`.

[STEP_SUCCESS]  
- `yes` if **all goals have been achieved** and **no further tool calls are required**, otherwise `no`.

[CONTENT]  
- If `[STRATEGY_CHANGE] = yes`, provide the **new full strategy** (plain text, no code).  
- If `[STEP_SUCCESS] = yes`, leave this section **empty**.  
- If `[STEP_SUCCESS] = no`, provide the **next Python code block** that may contain **one or multiple tool calls** needed to advance the strategy.

Coding rules for the ```python``` block:
- Each line must follow the pattern  
  `result = self.execute_task('<tool_name>', ['arg1', 'arg2', ...])`
- All arguments go inside the list.
- You may include **several lines** (i.e., call multiple tools) in a single code block when needed.
- No comments, explanations, markdown headers, or extra text outside the code block.

Failing to strictly follow this format will cause your output to be discarded.

Example of a valid answer when the task is still in progress:

[STRATEGY_CHANGE] no
[STEP_SUCCESS] no
